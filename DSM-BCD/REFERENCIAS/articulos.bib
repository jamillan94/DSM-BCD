Unfortunately, current screening modalities are imperfect, suffering from limited sensitivity and high false-positive rates. Novel techniques in the field of breast imaging may soon play a role in breast cancer screening: digital breast tomosynthesis, contrast material-enhanced spectral mammography, US (automated three-dimensional breast US, transmission tomography, elastography, optoacoustic imaging), MRI (abbreviated and ultrafast, diffusion-weighted imaging), and molecular breast imaging. Artificial intelligence and radiomics have the potential to further improve screening strategies. Furthermore, nonimaging-based screening tests such as liquid biopsy and breathing tests may transform the screening landscape.},

abstract = {Aim: To provide a comprehensive overview of breast cancer in Colombia. Methods: Data on breast cancer in Colombia are scarce. We present incidence data from population-based cancer registries that represent 4 distinct regions of the country. Other data originate from non-governmental institutions and healthcare providers within Colombia, official sources, expert opinion, Colombian legislation, and the Cancer Mortality Atlas publishes by Colombian National Cancer Institute. Results: In Colombia, the age-standardized incidence rate remained relatively stable between 2012 and 2020 (43.1 to 47.8 cases per 100,000 women-years); Additionally, survival since 1995 has presented a substantial improvement from 65.7 to 72.1. In 33% of cases, the diagnosis of breast cancer was made in advanced stages, stage III or higher. The health demography survey conducted in 2015 showed that the participation in mammography screening in women aged 40 to 69 remains low 48.1%. Some limitations regarding access to early detection and diagnosis include economic strata, health insurance coverage, origin, and accessibility. On average, a 90-day period was reported from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of breast cancer. Conclusion: The first action towards improving outcomes in breast cancer should be to improve stage at diagnosis and timely access to care.},

abstract = {Metabolomics holds the promise as a new technology to diagnose highly heterogeneous diseases. Conventionally, metabolomics data analysis for diagnosis is done using various statistical and machine learning based classification methods. However, it remains unknown if deep neural network, a class of increasingly popular machine learning methods, is suitable to classify metabolomics data. Here we use a cohort of 271 breast cancer tissues, 204 positive estrogen receptor (ER+), and 67 negative estrogen receptor (ER-) to test the accuracies of feed-forward networks, a deep learning (DL) framework, as well as six widely used machine learning models, namely random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), recursive partitioning and regression trees (RPART), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), prediction analysis for microarrays (PAM), and generalized boosted models (GBM). DL framework has the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 in classifying ER+/ER- patients, compared to the other six machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, the biological interpretation of the first hidden layer reveals eight commonly enriched significant metabolomics pathways (adjusted P-value <0.05) that cannot be discovered by other machine learning methods. Among them, protein digestion and absorption and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters pathways are also confirmed in integrated analysis between metabolomics and gene expression data in these samples. In summary, deep learning method shows advantages for metabolomics based breast cancer ER status classification, with both the highest prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.93) and better revelation of disease biology. We encourage the adoption of feed-forward networks based deep learning method in the metabolomics research community for classification.},

abstract = {The tumor proliferation, which is correlated with tumor grade, is a crucial biomarker indicative of breast cancer patients' prognosis. The most commonly used method in predicting tumor proliferation speed is the counting of mitotic figures in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H and E) histological slides. Manual mitosis counting is known to suffer from reproducibility problems. This paper presents a fully automated system for tumor proliferation prediction from whole slide images via mitosis counting. First, by considering the epithelial tissue as mitosis activity regions, we build a deep-learning-based region of interest detection method to select the high mitosis activity regions from whole slide images. Second, we learned a set of deep neural networks to detect mitosis detection from selected areas. The proposed mitosis detection system is designed to effectively overcome the mitosis detection challenges by two novel deep preprocessing and two-step hard negative mining approaches. Third, we trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict the final tumor proliferation score. The proposed method was evaluated on the dataset of the Tumor Proliferation Assessment Challenge (TUPAC16) and achieved a 73.81 % F-measure and 0.612 weighted kappa score, respectively, outperforming all previous approaches significantly. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system considerably improves the tumor proliferation prediction accuracy and provides a reliable automated tool to support health care make-decisions.},

abstract = {Screening mammography aims to identify breast cancer at earlier stages of the disease, when treatment can be more successful1. Despite the existence of screening programmes worldwide, the interpretation of mammograms is affected by high rates of false positives and false negatives2. Here we present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer prediction. To assess its performance in the clinical setting, we curated a large representative dataset from the UK and a large enriched dataset from the USA. We show an absolute reduction of 5.7% and 1.2% (USA and UK) in false positives and 9.4% and 2.7% in false negatives. We provide evidence of the ability of the system to generalize from the UK to the USA. In an independent study of six radiologists, the AI system outperformed all of the human readers: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for the AI system was greater than the AUC-ROC for the average radiologist by an absolute margin of 11.5%. We ran a simulation in which the AI system participated in the double-reading process that is used in the UK, and found that the AI system maintained non-inferior performance and reduced the workload of the second reader by 88%. This robust assessment of the AI system paves the way for clinical trials to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer screening.},

abstract = {Breast density, a breast cancer risk factor, is a radiologic feature that reflects fibroglandular tissue content relative to breast area or volume. Its histology is incompletely characterized. Here we use deep learning approaches to identify histologic correlates in radiologically-guided biopsies that may underlie breast density and distinguish cancer among women with elevated and low density. We evaluated hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)-stained digitized images from image-guided breast biopsies (n = 852 patients). Breast density was assessed as global and localized fibroglandular volume (%). A convolutional neural network characterized H and E composition. In total 37 features were extracted from the network output, describing tissue quantities and morphological structure. A random forest regression model was trained to identify correlates most predictive of fibroglandular volume (n = 588). Correlations between predicted and radiologically quantified fibroglandular volume were assessed in 264 independent patients. A second random forest classifier was trained to predict diagnosis (invasive vs. benign); performance was assessed using area under receiver-operating characteristics curves (AUC). Using extracted features, regression models predicted global (r = 0.94) and localized (r = 0.93) fibroglandular volume, with fat and non-fatty stromal content representing the strongest correlates, followed by epithelial organization rather than quantity. For predicting cancer among high and low fibroglandular volume, the classifier achieved AUCs of 0.92 and 0.84, respectively, with epithelial organizational features ranking most important. These results suggest non-fatty stroma, fat tissue quantities and epithelial region organization predict fibroglandular volume. The model holds promise for identifying histological correlates of cancer risk in patients with high and low density and warrants further evaluation.},

@article{Hu2020,
abstract = {Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has been shown to improve radiologists' performance in the clinical diagnosis of breast cancer. This machine learning study develops a deep transfer learning computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) methodology to diagnose breast cancer using mpMRI. The retrospective study included clinical MR images of 927 unique lesions from 616 women. Each MR study included a dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI sequence and a T2-weighted (T2w) MRI sequence. A pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to extract features from the DCE and T2w sequences, and support vector machine classifiers were trained on the CNN features to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions. Three methods that integrate the sequences at different levels (image fusion, feature fusion, and classifier fusion) were investigated. Classification performance was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and compared using the DeLong test. The single-sequence classifiers yielded areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) [95% confidence intervals] of AUCDCE = 0.85 [0.82, 0.88] and AUCT2w = 0.78 [0.75, 0.81]. The multiparametric schemes yielded AUCImageFusion = 0.85 [0.82, 0.88], AUCFeatureFusion = 0.87 [0.84, 0.89], and AUCClassifierFusion = 0.86 [0.83, 0.88]. The feature fusion method statistically significantly outperformed using DCE alone (P < 0.001). In conclusion, the proposed deep transfer learning CADx method for mpMRI may improve diagnostic performance by reducing the false positive rate and improving the positive predictive value in breast imaging interpretation.},

abstract = {Traditional computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) processes include feature extraction, selection, and classification. Effective feature extraction in CAD is important in improving the classification's performance. We introduce a machine-learning method and have designed an analysis procedure of benign and malignant breast tumour classification in ultrasound (US) images without a need for a priori tumour region-selection processing, thereby decreasing clinical diagnosis efforts while maintaining high classification performance. Our dataset constituted 677 US images (benign: 312, malignant: 365). Regarding two-dimensional US images, the oriented gradient descriptors' histogram pyramid was extracted and utilised to obtain feature vectors. The correlation-based feature selection method was used to evaluate and select significant feature sets for further classification. Sequential minimal optimisation—combining local weight learning—was utilised for classification and performance enhancement. The image dataset's classification performance showed an 81.64% sensitivity and 87.76% specificity for malignant images (area under the curve = 0.847). The positive and negative predictive values were 84.1 and 85.8%, respectively. Here, a new workflow, utilising machine learning to recognise malignant US images was proposed. Comparison of physician diagnoses and the automatic classifications made using machine learning yielded similar outcomes. This indicates the potential applicability of machine learning in clinical diagnoses.},

@article{Shen2019,
abstract = {We develop an end-to-end training algorithm for whole-image breast cancer diagnosis based on mammograms. It requires lesion annotations only at the first stage of training. After that, a whole image classifier can be trained using only image level labels. This greatly reduced the reliance on lesion annotations. Our approach is implemented using an all convolutional design that is simple yet provides superior performance in comparison with the previous methods. On DDSM, our best single-model achieves a per-image AUC score of 0.88 and three-model averaging increases the score to 0.91. On INbreast, our best single-model achieves a per-image AUC score of 0.96. Using DDSM as benchmark, our models compare favorably with the current state-of-the-art. We also demonstrate that a whole image model trained on DDSM can be easily transferred to INbreast without using its lesion annotations and using only a small amount of training data.

@article{Naik2020,
abstract = {For newly diagnosed breast cancer, estrogen receptor status (ERS) is a key molecular marker used for prognosis and treatment decisions. During clinical management, ERS is determined by pathologists from immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of biopsied tissue for the targeted receptor, which highlights the presence of cellular surface antigens. This is an expensive, time-consuming process which introduces discordance in results due to variability in IHC preparation and pathologist subjectivity. In contrast, hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining—which highlights cellular morphology—is quick, less expensive, and less variable in preparation. Here we show that machine learning can determine molecular marker status, as assessed by hormone receptors, directly from cellular morphology. We develop a multiple instance learning-based deep neural network that determines ERS from H and E-stained whole slide images (WSI). Our algorithm—trained strictly with WSI-level annotations—is accurate on a varied, multi-country dataset of 3,474 patients, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 for sensitivity and specificity. Our approach has the potential to augment clinicians' capabilities in cancer prognosis and theragnosis by harnessing biological signals imperceptible to the human eye.},

abstract = {The nuclear protein Ki-67 and Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been introduced as prognostic factors in predicting both tumor progression and probable response to chemotherapy. The value of Ki-67 index and TILs in approach to heterogeneous tumors such as Breast cancer (BC) that is the most common cancer in women worldwide, has been highlighted in literature. Considering that estimation of both factors are dependent on professional pathologists' observation and inter-individual variations may also exist, automated methods using machine learning, specifically approaches based on deep learning, have attracted attention. Yet, deep learning methods need considerable annotated data. In the absence of publicly available benchmarks for BC Ki-67 cell detection and further annotated classification of cells, In this study we propose SHIDC-BC-Ki-67 as a dataset for the aforementioned purpose. We also introduce a novel pipeline and backend, for estimation of Ki-67 expression and simultaneous determination of intratumoral TILs score in breast cancer cells. Further, we show that despite the challenges that our proposed model has encountered, our proposed backend, PathoNet, outperforms the state of the art methods proposed to date with regard to harmonic mean measure acquired. Dataset is publicly available in http://shiraz-hidc.com and all experiment codes are published in https://github.com/SHIDCenter/PathoNet .},

We give an overview of the research focus, current methodologies, best practices and possible gaps in conducting the six phases of CRISP-DM. The main findings are that CRISP-DM is still a defactor standard in data mining, but there are challenges since the most studies do not foresee a deployment phase. The contribution of our paper is to identify best practices and process phases in which data mining analysts can be better supported. Further contribution is a template for structuring and releasing CRISP-DM studies.},

abstract = {Data science has employed great research efforts in developing advanced analytics, improving data models and cultivating new algorithms. However, not many authors have come across the organizational and socio-technical challenges that arise when executing a data science project: lack of vision and clear objectives, a biased emphasis on technical issues, a low level of maturity for ad-hoc projects and the ambiguity of roles in data science are among these challenges. Few methodologies have been proposed on the literature that tackle these type of challenges, some of them date back to the mid-1990, and consequently they are not updated to the current paradigm and the latest developments in big data and machine learning technologies. In addition, fewer methodologies offer a complete guideline across team, project and data & information management. In this article we would like to explore the necessity of developing a more holistic approach for carrying out data science projects. We first review methodologies that have been presented on the literature to work on data science projects and classify them according to the their focus: project, team, data and information management. Finally, we propose a conceptual framework containing general characteristics that a methodology for managing data science projects with a holistic point of view should have. This framework can be used by other researchers as a roadmap for the design of new data science methodologies or the updating of existing ones.},

We then examine how conceptual modeling can be applied to machine learning and propose a framework for incorporating conceptual modeling into data science projects. The framework is illustrated by applying it to a healthcare application. For the inverse pairing, machine learning can impact conceptual modeling through text and rule mining, as well as knowledge graphs. The pairing of conceptual modeling and machine learning in this way should help lay the foundations for future research.},

abstract = {The volume of data that is generated each day is rising rapidly. There is a need to analyze this data efficiently and produce results quickly. Data science offers a formal methodology for processing and analyzing data. It involves a work-flow with multiple stages, such as, data collection, data wrangling, statistical analysis and machine learning. In this paper, we look at data analytics systems that support the data science work-flow. The variety of current commercial and open-source data analytics systems differ significantly in terms of available features, functionality, and scalability. A benchmark can be used to evaluate the functionality and performance of a system. However, there is no standard benchmark for evaluating or comparing these data systems for doing data science. In this paper, we introduce a data science benchmark, Sanzu, to evaluate systems with data processing and analytics tasks. Our benchmark includes a micro and macro benchmark. The micro benchmark tests basic operations in isolation. It consists of task suites for reading and writing, data wrangling, statistical analysis, machine learning and time series analysis. Each macro workload evaluates an analytics application where a series of analysis or functions are based on a real world application. The macro benchmark focuses on sports and smart grid analytics. We evaluate these tasks on five different popular data science frameworks and systems: R, Anaconda Python, Dask, PostgreSQL (MADlib) and PySpark. For micro benchmark we generate synthetic datasets with 3 scale factors: 1, 10 and 100 (scale factor 1=1 million). The macro benchmark uses data generated from real-world data sources.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has required greater minute-to-minute urgency of patient treatment in Intensive Care Units (ICUs), rendering the use of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) too slow to be effective for treatment discovery. There is a need for agility in clinical research, and the use of data science to develop predictive models for patient treatment is a potential solution. However, rapidly developing predictive models in healthcare is challenging given the complexity of healthcare problems and the lack of regular interaction between data scientists and physicians. Data scientists can spend significant time working in isolation to build predictive models that may not be useful in clinical environments. We propose the use of an agile data science framework based on the Scrumban framework used in software development. Scrumban is an iterative framework, where in each iteration larger problems are broken down into simple do-able tasks for data scientists and physicians. The two sides collaborate closely in formulating clinical questions and developing and deploying predictive models into clinical settings. Physicians can provide feedback or new hypotheses given the performance of the model, and refinement of the model or clinical questions can take place in the next iteration. The rapid development of predictive models can now be achieved with increasing numbers of publicly available healthcare datasets and easily accessible cloud-based data science tools. What is truly needed are data scientist and physician partnerships ensuring close collaboration between the two sides in using these tools to develop clinically useful predictive models to meet the demands of the COVID-19 healthcare landscape.},

While the number of data science projects is growing, unfortunately, there is a slight consideration of how a team performs a data science project. Although the existence of a repeatable well-defined process could deal with many challenges of data science projects, researches conducted in recent years indicate a convergence of the results to agile methodologies as the appropriate ones for the projects. In this paper, first, the tasks and roles of individuals in data science projects are addressed; then, some research conducted for the methodologies used in the projects are studied. The study shows that agile methodologies could resolve many issues of data science projects by increasing the communications and cooperation of the team members and investors.},

   abstract = {Extracting knowledge from Big Data is the process of transforming this data into actionable information. The exponential growth of data has initiated a myriad of new opportunities, and made data become the most valuable raw material of production for many organizations. Mining Big Data is coupled with some challenges, known as the 3V's of Big Data: Volume, Variety and Velocity. However, a major challenge that needs to be addressed, and often is ignored in the literature, concerns reliability. Actually, data is agglomerated from multiple disparate sources, and each of Knowledge Discovery (KDD) process steps may be carried out by different organizations. These considerations lead us to ask a critical question that is weather the information we have at each step is reliable enough to proceed to the next one? This paper therefore aims to provide a framework that automatically assesses reliability of the knowledge discovery process. We focus on Linked Open Data (LOD) as a source of data, as it constitutes a relevant data provider in many Big Data applications. However, our framework can also be adapted for unstructured data. This framework will assist scientists to automatically and efficiently measure the reliability of each KDD process stage as well as detect unreliable steps that should be revised. Following this methodology, KDD process will be optimized and therefore produce knowledge with higher quality.},

The development of breast cancer is a multi-step process involving multiple cell types, and its prevention remains challenging in the world. Early diagnosis of breast cancer is one of the best approaches to prevent this disease. In some developed countries, the 5-year relative survival rate of breast cancer patients is above 80% due to early prevention. In the recent decade, great progress has been made in the understanding of breast cancer as well as in the development of preventative methods. The pathogenesis and tumor drug-resistant mechanisms are revealed by discovering breast cancer stem cells, and many genes are found related to breast cancer. Currently, people have more drug options for the chemoprevention of breast cancer, while biological prevention has been recently developed to improve patients’ quality of life. In this review, we will summarize key studies of pathogenesis, related genes, risk factors and preventative methods on breast cancer over the past years. These findings represent a small step in the long fight against breast cancer.},

   abstract = {Objective: The goal of this study is to use adjunctive classes to improve a predictive model whose performance is limited by the common problems of small numbers of primary cases, high feature dimensionality, and poor class separability. Specifically, our clinical task is to use mammographic features to predict whether ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) identified at needle core biopsy will be later upstaged or shown to contain invasive breast cancer. Methods: To improve the prediction of pure DCIS (negative) versus upstaged DCIS (positive) cases, this study considers the adjunctive roles of two related classes: atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), a non-cancer type of breast abnormity, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), with 113 computer vision based mammographic features extracted from each case. To improve the baseline Model A's classification of pure vs. upstaged DCIS, we designed three different strategies (Models B, C, D) with different ways of embedding features or inputs. Results: Based on ROC analysis, the baseline Model A performed with AUC of 0.614 (95% CI, 0.496-0.733). All three new models performed better than the baseline, with domain adaptation (Model D) performing the best with an AUC of 0.697 (95% CI, 0.595-0.797). Conclusion: We improved the prediction performance of DCIS upstaging by embedding two related pathology classes in different training phases. Significance: The three new strategies of embedding related class data all outperformed the baseline model, thus demonstrating not only feature similarities among these different classes, but also the potential for improving classification by using other related classes.},

   abstract = {Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is the most common type of breast cancer accounting for almost 22% of all female cancers in the world. Conventionally, IDC is diagnosed by a pathologist after observing changes in the nuclear morphology of cancer cells. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to diagnose IDC by the analysis and processing of cytology images using MATLAB. The algorithm quantifies nuclear morphological parameters like size, the regularity of the nuclear margin and level of chromatin clumping for nuclei present in each cytology smear by using a sequence of image processing steps. After quantification of these parameters, a comparison is made between normal and IDC images using which a threshold is set for these parameters. These thresholds are then used to make a diagnosis for IDC where the algorithm classifies a cytology image as either normal or cancer. The algorithm therefore finds applications in automated screening programs. © 2011 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Twenty-eight women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast treated by biopsy only were identified in a histologic review of 11,760 biopsies performed between 1950 and 1968. Seven of the 25 women followed for more than three years developed invasive breast carcinoma, all in the same breast with a previously detected DCIS. Average follow-up interval for the 18 women not developing invasive carcinoma was 16 years. The invasive carcinomas presented clinically from three to ten years (average, 6.1) after the biopsies demonstrating DCIS. Four women with invasive carcinoma developed distant metastases following mastectomy. This study suggests that 28% of women treated with biopsy only for DCIS presenting as an incidental histologic finding will develop invasive carcinoma in a follow-up period of approximately 15 years. Cancer 49:751-758, 1982. NOWLEDGE OF THE natural history of mammary K carcinoma in situ (CIS) is the basis of prognos-tication and therapeutic recommendation. The diagnosis cannot be established without first removing a portion of breast for microscopic examination. Accepting that this procedure will alter the natural history by removing some or all of the cancer, the nearest we can come to predicting clinical outcome of patients with CIS is to follow women after biopsy. This will not reveal the unaltered natural history of these lesions, but will serve to answer the practical question of what will happen if further therapy is not performed following identification of CIS at biopsy. The present study was undertaken in order to determine the natural history of intraductal carcinoma of the breast (DCIS) following treatment by biopsy only. There are few reports in the literature concerning ductal carcinoma in situ treated by biopsy only, and most of these contain small numbers of cases in series primarily devoted to patients treated by mastectomy. The study of Betsill et al.,' updated recenty by Rosen et a1.,2 is the only one presenting a series of patients similar to those reported here. Materials and Methods The surgical pathology diagnoses at Vanderbilt and Baptist Hospitals in Nashville, Tennessee were reviewed from 1952 to 1968, inclusive. All breast biopsies with diagnoses other than malignancy, fibroadenoma, or abscess were reviewed histologically for the presence of epithelial proliferative disease. There were 3,607 biopsies reviewed at Baptist Hospital (after exclusion of 3 1 cases in which slides were missing from the file), and 2,449 biopsies reviewed from Vanderbilt Hospital (after exclusion of 29 cases in which slides and blocks were missing). Similarly, all breast biopsies performed at the St. Thomas Hospital during the years 1950 through 1968 were histologically reviewed, producing an additional 5,704 biopsies containing breast tissue. A total of 21 cases were missing from the files at this hospital. Review of microscopic notes and the diagnoses of cases missing from the file contained no indication that the missing cases were a selected or biased group containing a greater number of atypical epithelial lesions than the cases reviewed. Initial histologic review of all available slides was carried out by one of the authors (DLP). At this time, diagnoses of CIS or atypical hyperplasia were recorded, and slides of these cases were submitted to the second pathologist (LWR), who reviewed the slides and assigned diagnoses to individual cases without knowledge of the diagnoses recorded previously.

This prospective study included 85 consecutive cases that were presented at gynecologic oncology MTBCs in our tertiary university hospital between January 2015 and April 2016. The primary endpoint was treatment plan change rate, which included both major and minor changes. Major changes were defined as exchange, addition, or subtraction of treatment modality. Minor changes included all other, such as intramodality changes or treatment time changes. The secondary endpoints were the change rates of diagnosis, diagnostic work-up, and radiological and pathological findings. The treatment plan change rate, irrespective of changes in diagnostic work-up, was 27.1%, which included 10.6% major and 16.5% minor changes. Among the treatment plan changes, changes in the treatment plan change rate alone were noted in 16.5% of cases, and changes in diagnosis and radiological findings occurred in 7.1% and 3.5% of cases, respectively. Diagnosis and radiological findings, irrespective of changes in diagnostic work-up, were also changed in 9.4% and 10.6% of cases, respectively. However, there were no changes in pathological findings. Moreover, there was a change of diagnostic method for further work-up in 23.5% of cases. The implementation rate of MTBC-determined treatment changes was 91.8%. Gynecologic oncology MTBCs resulted in considerable changes in treatment plans. Diagnosis, diagnostic work-up, and radiological findings were influenced by MTBCs. The data emphasize the importance of adopting a multidisciplinary team approach for gynecologic cancer management.},

@article{Masciari2007,
   abstract = {Background: The cell surface glycoprotein E-cadherin ( CDH1 ) is a key regulator of adhesive properties in epithelial cells. Germline mutations in CDH1 are well established as the defects underlying hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) syndrome, and an increased risk of lobular breast cancer (LBC) has been described in HDGC kindreds. However, germline CDH1 mutations have not been described in patients with LBC in non-HDGC families. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of germline CDH1 mutations in patients with LBC with early onset disease or family histories of breast cancer without DGC.
               Methods: Germline DNA was analysed in 23 women with invasive lobular or mixed ductal and lobular breast cancers who had at least one close relative with breast cancer or had themselves been diagnosed before the age of 45 years, had tested negative for a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, and reported no personal or family history of diffuse gastric cancer. The full coding sequence of CDH1 including splice junctions was amplified using PCR and screened for mutations using DHPLC and sequencing.
               Results: A novel germline CDH1 truncating mutation in the extracellular portion of the protein (517insA) was identified in one woman who had LBC at the age of 42 years and a first degree relative with invasive LBC.
               Conclusions: Germline CDH1 mutations can be associated with invasive LBC in the absence of diffuse gastric cancer. The finding, if confirmed, may have implications for management of individuals at risk for this breast cancer subtype. Clarification of the cancer risks in the syndrome is essential.},

   abstract = {Background: The expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is predictive of response to chemotherapy in cancer patients. We tested the hypothesis that drug-resistant CTCs might have predictive value in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and possibly retain stem-like properties. Patients and methods: CTCs obtained from 42 MBC patients were evaluated for multidrug-resistance-related proteins (MRPs), aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), estrogen receptor α (ERα) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu). Primary objective was to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of CTCs profile. Secondary end points were the level of concordance in ERα and HER2/neu status between primary tumors and CTCs and the correlation in CTCs between ALDH1, drug resistance profile and number of MRPs. Results: A difference in progression-free survival (PFS) was found between CTCs-positive and CTCs-negative patients. PFS was shorter in patients with a 'drug resistance' CTCs profile and in patients whose CTCs expressed two or more MRPs. No correlation was found between tumor characteristics and ALDH1. ALDH1 correlated to negative ERα and positive HER2/neu status in CTCs. The correlation between the number of MRPs expressed in CTCs and ALDH1 was statistically significant. Conclusion: In MBC, the presence of CTCs expressing MRPs and ALDH1 is predictive of response to chemotherapy. © The Author 2010.

It is characterized by rapid progression, local and distant metastases, younger age of onset, and lower overall survival compared with other breast cancers. Historically, IBC is a lethal disease with less than a 5% survival rate beyond 5 years when treated with surgery or radiation therapy. Because of its rarity, IBC is often misdiagnosed as mastitis or generalized dermatitis. This review examines IBC's unique clinical presentation, pathology, epidemiology, imaging, and biology and details current multidisciplinary management of the disease, which comprises systemic therapy, surgery, and radiation therapy.},

   abstract = {Nipple discharge is a common symptom that mostly results from benign conditions. The most significant cause is carcinoma, which accounts for 1%-45% of cases. Therefore, identification of intraductal lesions is important. Conventional ductography, the recommended method of identifying lesions, is invasive and has inherent limitations. Magnetic resonance (MR) ductography is performed with heavily T2-weighted sequences; it is noninvasive and requires neither radiation nor contrast media. Like conventional ductography, MR ductography shows the dilated ducts as tubular structures with high signal intensity. Intraductal lesions appear as a signal defect, duct wall irregularity, or ductal obstruction. No specific conventional ductographic or MR ductography finding allows differentiation between benign and malignant disease, and neither technique can demonstrate the extent of disease. MR mammography with intravenous injection of contrast material reveals the extent of disease, and a dynamic study may help distinguish between malignant and benign lesions. Fusion imaging with MR ductography and MR mammography demonstrates not only the presence of an intraductal abnormality but also the extent of the lesion on one image, thus clearly showing the relationship between the dilated duct and the intraductal lesion. © RSNA, 2007.},

Here, we comprehensively profiled 817 breast tumors, including 127 ILC, 490 ductal (IDC), and 88 mixed IDC/ILC. Besides E-cadherin loss, the best known ILC genetic hallmark, we identified mutations targeting PTEN, TBX3, and FOXA1 as ILC enriched features. PTEN loss associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, which was highest in ILC among all breast cancer subtypes. Spatially clustered FOXA1 mutations correlated with increased FOXA1 expression and activity. Conversely, GATA3 mutations and high expression characterized luminal A IDC, suggesting differential modulation of ER activity in ILC and IDC. Proliferation and immune-related signatures determined three ILC transcriptional subtypes associated with survival differences. Mixed IDC/ILC cases were molecularly classified as ILC-like and IDC-like revealing no true hybrid features. This multidimensional molecular atlas sheds new light on the genetic bases of ILC and provides potential clinical options.},

We propose a molecular classification dividing gastric cancer into four subtypes: tumours positive for Epstein-Barr virus, which display recurrent PIK3CA mutations, extreme DNA hypermethylation, and amplification of JAK2, CD274 (also known as PD-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (also known as PD-L2); microsatellite unstable tumours, which show elevated mutation rates, including mutations of genes encoding targetable oncogenic signalling proteins; genomically stable tumours, which are enriched for the diffuse histological variant and mutations of RHOA or fusions involving RHO-family GTPase-activating proteins; and tumours with chromosomal instability, which show marked aneuploidy and focal amplification of receptor tyrosine kinases.

@article{W.N.1993,
	abstract = {Interactive image processing techniques, along with a linear-programming-based inductive classiier, have been used to create a highly accurate system for diagnosis of breast tumors. A small fraction of a ne needle aspirate slide is selected and digitized. With an interactive interface, the user initializes active contour models, known as snakes, near the boundaries of a set of cell nuclei. The customized snakes are deformed to the exact shape of the nuclei. This allows for precise, automated analysis of nuclear size, shape and texture. Ten such features are computed for each nucleus, and the mean value, largest (or $\backslash$worst") value and standard error of each feature are found over the range of isolated cells. After 569 images were analyzed in this fashion, diierent combinations of features were tested to nd those which best separate benign from malignant samples. Ten-fold cross-validation accuracy of 97{\%} was achieved using a single separating plane on three of the thirty features: mean texture, worst area and worst smoothness. This represents an improvement over the best diagnostic results in the medical literature. The system is currently in use at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals. The same feature set has also been utilized in the much more diicult task of predicting distant recurrence of malignancy in patients, resulting in an accuracy of 86{\%}.},
