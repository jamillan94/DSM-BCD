\section{Conclusion}
Because that data science is a multidisciplinary field which incorporates computational tools that allow to give value to the data and learn from them in order to make a decision that validates the veracity of a hypothesis raised, it is the best option to generate a meaningful diagnosis in the detection of this disease. Given the above, although most researchers have put their efforts into breast cancer diagnostics and prognostics, each technique has a different accuracy rate that varies according to the different situations, tools and datasets being used. As data analytics capabilities become more accessible and prevalent, data scientists can find great support in the DSM-BCD methodology because it provides a guiding strategy, independent of the technologies, data volumes or approaches involved, and enables improved performance of ML and DL models to ensure agile and effective diagnosis of breast cancer.
